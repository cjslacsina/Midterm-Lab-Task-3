- This portfolio illustrates how to use Excel to build an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard. By utilizing pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for visualization, the dashboard explores employment trends across industries, job distribution, and compensation patterns by role and company size.

## Step by Step Process:
**Step 1: Use the provided data**  
Open the “Uncleaned DS Jobs” worksheet along with the Transform Tables:  
- Sal By Role  
- Sal By State  
- Sal By Size  

**Step 2: Design the dashboard to emphasize the following**:  
- State with the highest number of Data Science jobs  
- Job role with the highest average salary  
- Company size offering the highest salary  
- Sector with the fewest and most Data Science jobs  
- Sector with the lowest and highest average salary  

**Step 3: Create a pivot table**  
Summarize data for sector jobs and salary (columns D & E) using pivot tables.  

**Step 4: Generate charts for visualization**  
Use bar, column, or pie charts to display salary trends and job distribution.  

**Step 5: Insert slicers for filtering**  
Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to enhance interactivity.  

**Step 6: Add a map (optional)**  
If your Excel version supports it, insert a map visualization to display job distribution by state.  

**Step 7: Apply design and formatting**  
Customize the dashboard’s colors, fonts, and layout to make it visually engaging.  

**Step 8: Complete the dashboard**  
Ensure that all necessary visuals and reports are included, with functional and interactive slicers.
